# GreenVancouver
## About
This Android app consumes Open Data of [Greenest City Projects](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/greenest-city-projects/information/) from City of Vancouver. As per requirements of BCIT CST Comp3217 (Mobile Development with Android Technologies), this app integrates new Android technologies and novel design ideas, resulting in a fully functional and user-intuitive Android App.

### Problem to solve
Many "green" initiatives exist in Vancouver, but citizens aren’t aware of all of them and don’t get involved.

### Solution
This app allows users to browse through countless green projects in the app, bookmark their favourites, leave reviews, and apply to volunteer for certain projects, all in one convenient location.

## Prerequists
Android 8.0 or later

## Using the App
### Features

#### Apply to Volunteer
This app features voluntary job applications of Greenest City Projects to improve users' awareness and involvements.
